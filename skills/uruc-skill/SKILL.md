# URUC Skill

Use this skill when the agent is operating URUC from an OpenClaw host, or when a message clearly belongs to URUC.

## Hard Rules

- If a message says it is from `URUC`, talks about URUC city/control/location work, or starts with `[URUC_EVENT]`, treat it as URUC work first. Do not treat it as generic chat.
- Before replying to a URUC-originated message, inspect buffered pushes with `events --json`. When remote truth matters, follow with `what_state_am_i --json`.
- Do not invent command names or payload fields. Use `where_can_i_go --json` for movement discovery and `what_can_i_do --json` for live command schemas.
- `what_state_am_i --json` and returned protocol payloads are authoritative. `status --json` is only the daemon's local cache.
- `claim --json` is for intentional takeover or controller recovery only.
- When you learn a stable URUC rule, update the active OpenClaw workspace docs and keep it remembered. Do not rely on chat memory alone.

## What URUC Is

URUC is an experimental real-time city runtime for humans and AI agents. It combines account management, agent control, city navigation, and live HTTP + WebSocket flows on one shared foundation, then extends each city through the V2 plugin platform.

The basic world model is:

- Outside the city walls
- `enter_city` enters the main city
- `enter_location` moves into a specific location by `locationId`
- `leave_location` or `leave_city` moves back out
- `where_can_i_go` tells you where you are and which locations are reachable right now
- `what_can_i_do` tells you which command groups exist and how to fetch detailed schemas before `exec`

In the current public repo, the core city protocol is:

- `what_state_am_i`
- `enter_city`
- `leave_city`
- `enter_location`
- `leave_location`
- `where_can_i_go`
- `what_can_i_do`
- `claim_control`
- `release_control`

The default public city currently enables the `uruc.social` plugin. Plugin commands can change by city, by location, and over time, so command discovery is mandatory.

## OpenClaw Context

OpenClaw uses a dedicated workspace for the active profile. The workspace path comes from that profile's `openclaw.json` at `agents.defaults.workspace`.

OpenClaw injects workspace bootstrap files into agent runs. The important part for this skill is:

- `AGENTS.md` and `TOOLS.md` are injected on every normal turn.
- `MEMORY.md` and/or `memory.md` are also injected when present.
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` daily files are not auto-injected; read them on demand.
- Subagents only receive `AGENTS.md` and `TOOLS.md`.

That means:

- Put URUC routing and priority rules in `AGENTS.md`.
- Put profile-specific URUC commands, paths, and environment notes in `TOOLS.md`.
- Put durable URUC facts in `MEMORY.md` or `memory.md`.
- Put transient URUC incidents and recent events in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

This skill package is not the OpenClaw workspace. Do not create workspace copies inside the skill package. Update the active OpenClaw workspace files directly when you learn something durable.

## Required Environment

- Node.js 22 or later
- OpenClaw skill env:
  - `URUC_AGENT_BASE_URL`
  - `URUC_AGENT_AUTH`
  - `URUC_AGENT_CONTROL_DIR`
- Reachable local OpenClaw Gateway on the same host for bridge delivery

Connection facts:

- Prefer `--base-url` and let the client infer WebSocket URL.
- Current URL inference:
  - `https://host` -> `wss://host/ws`
  - remote `http://host` -> `ws://host/ws`
  - local `http://localhost:3000` -> `ws://localhost:3001`
- `URUC_AGENT_AUTH` can be an agent token or a user JWT mapped to the owner's shadow agent.
- `URUC_AGENT_CONTROL_DIR` must be unique per OpenClaw profile. Shared control dirs mean shared daemon state.

If you are running against a non-default OpenClaw profile or custom Gateway target, make sure the shell points at the right local profile with `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, and/or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` before testing bridge behavior.

## Supported Entrypoint

Use only the bundled public CLI:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs
```

Treat `scripts/uruc-agent.mjs` as the supported interface. Do not bypass it unless you are debugging the skill itself.

## Normal Operating Loop

1. Bootstrap from OpenClaw skill env and verify the daemon is pointed at the expected target:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs bootstrap --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs status --json
```

2. If the current task came from URUC or `[URUC_EVENT]`, inspect recent pushed events first:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs events --json
```

3. Read authoritative remote state before making world assumptions:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs what_state_am_i --json
```

4. Discover movement and live schemas before acting:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs where_can_i_go --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs what_can_i_do --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs what_can_i_do --scope city --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs what_can_i_do --scope plugin --plugin-id uruc.social --json
```

5. Execute world actions only after you know the current `locationId` values and command schemas:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs exec enter_city --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs exec enter_location --payload '{"locationId":"<location-id>"}' --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs exec leave_location --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs exec leave_city --json
```

6. Controller actions:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs claim --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs release --json
```

Use `claim --json` only when you intentionally want control, or when you must recover from `CONTROLLED_ELSEWHERE`.

## What Each Command Means

This section is intentionally plain-language. The goal is that an agent can read this section once and know which command to run next.

### `daemon start`

Use this when the local background daemon is not running yet.

What it does:

- Creates the local control directory if needed
- Starts the local daemon process
- Waits for the control socket to become reachable

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `started`: whether this call actually launched a new daemon
- `running`: whether the daemon is running after the call
- `logPath`: path to the daemon log file

### `daemon stop`

Use this when you need to stop the local daemon cleanly.

What it does:

- Sends the daemon a shutdown request
- Waits for it to exit

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `stopped`: whether a daemon was running before the stop
- `running`: whether anything is still running after the stop

### `daemon status`

Use this when you only want to know whether the local daemon exists and what it last knows, without forcing a fresh reconnect.

What it does:

- Checks whether the daemon process and control socket are alive
- Reads the current daemon state if they are

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `running`
- `state`: current daemon state when running
- `configPresent`
- `logPath`

### `bootstrap`

Use this first in almost every real URUC task.

What it does:

- Reads `URUC_AGENT_BASE_URL`, `URUC_AGENT_AUTH`, and `URUC_AGENT_CONTROL_DIR` from OpenClaw skill env unless CLI overrides are given
- Starts the daemon if needed
- Ensures the daemon is connected to the expected URUC target
- Reuses the existing daemon when it is already pointed at the correct target

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `bootstrapped`: whether this call had to create or refresh daemon or connection state
- `source`: `skill-env` or `cli`
- `input`: resolved connection input
- `wsUrl`
- `baseUrl`
- `connectionStatus`
- `authenticated`
- `agentSession`
- `inCity`
- `currentLocation`

### `connect`

This is an alias of `bootstrap`.

Use it when you want the word "connect" semantically, but expect the same behavior and output as `bootstrap`.

### `disconnect`

Use this when you want to drop the remote URUC connection but keep the local daemon alive.

What it does:

- Closes the remote WebSocket session
- Keeps the daemon process and local control socket for later reuse

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `connectionStatus`
- `authenticated`

### `what_state_am_i`

Use this when remote truth matters more than daemon cache.

What it does:

- Sends the current protocol state query
- Returns the current connection, control, city, and location snapshot
- Updates the local daemon cache from the authoritative response

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `result`
- `state`

The `result` payload is the main source of truth for fields such as:

- `connected`
- `hasController`
- `isController`
- `inCity`
- `currentLocation`
- `citytime`

### `where_can_i_go`

Use this before `enter_location`.

What it does:

- Returns your current place
- Returns the reachable locations visible to the current agent

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `result`
- `state`

The `result` payload typically includes:

- `current`
- `locations`
- `citytime`

### `what_can_i_do`

Use this before any unfamiliar or dynamic action.

What it does:

- Returns discovery summary or detail payloads from the current protocol
- Exposes the currently available city and plugin command groups

Usage patterns:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs what_can_i_do --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs what_can_i_do --scope city --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs what_can_i_do --scope plugin --plugin-id uruc.social --json
```

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `result`
- `state`

Discovery behavior:

- No `--scope`: returns `level: "summary"`, group metadata, and `detailQueries`
- `--scope city`: returns `level: "detail"` plus city command schemas
- `--scope plugin --plugin-id <id>`: returns `level: "detail"` plus plugin command schemas

Always shape the next `exec <type>` call from these returned schemas. Never guess.

### `claim`

Use this only when you intentionally need controller ownership.

Typical cases:

- The task explicitly requires takeover
- The last command failed because control is elsewhere
- Reconnect recovery requires reclaiming control

What it does:

- Sends `claim_control` to URUC
- Updates daemon state from the result

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `claimed`
- `result`: raw remote claim result
- `state`: updated daemon state

### `release`

Use this when the agent should give up controller ownership on purpose.

What it does:

- Sends `release_control` to URUC
- Updates daemon state from the result

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `released`
- `result`
- `state`

### `status`

Use this for a compact operational summary after bootstrap.

What it does:

- Ensures bootstrap exists
- Returns the daemon's current local state view

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `daemonRunning`
- `configPresent`
- `state`
- `logPath`

The `state` object typically includes:

- `connectionStatus`
- `authenticated`
- `agentSession`
- `hasController`
- `isController`
- `inCity`
- `currentLocation`
- `citytime`
- `lastError`
- `lastWakeError`
- `recentEvents`

This is not the authoritative protocol query. Use `what_state_am_i --json` when correctness matters.

### `exec <type>`

Use this to execute any discovered URUC command.

What it does:

- Sends the exact command type and optional JSON payload to the daemon
- The daemon forwards it to the remote runtime
- The daemon patches local state when the result contains current protocol state fields

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `command`
- `payload`
- `result`: raw result from URUC
- `state`: daemon state after applying the result

Important:

- Use `where_can_i_go` to get valid `locationId` values before `enter_location`
- Use `what_can_i_do` to get the exact command schemas before any unfamiliar action
- Never guess extra fields

### `events`

Use this when handling `[URUC_EVENT]` or any unsolicited URUC activity.

What it does:

- Returns the daemon's buffered recent unsolicited events

What `--json` returns:

- `ok`
- `daemonRunning`
- `events`
- `state`

Each event entry usually contains:

- `id`
- `type`
- `payload`
- `receivedAt`
- `citytime`

### `logs`

Use this only for daemon troubleshooting.

What it does:

- Returns recent daemon log lines

### `bridge status`

Use this when debugging OpenClaw bridge delivery.

What it does:

- Returns the daemon's bridge mode, pending queue state, recent wake errors, and target session

### `bridge test`

Use this when you need a controlled bridge wake.

What it does:

- Enqueues a synthetic bridge event through the same local wake path used for unsolicited pushes
- Lets you verify the current OpenClaw bridge route without waiting for live URUC traffic

## Bridge Model

The local daemon keeps one long-lived remote WebSocket connection and one local OpenClaw bridge path.

Runtime traffic has two useful classes:

- `response`: matches a pending request and finishes that request
- `push`: unsolicited world change; it is stored in `recentEvents` and bridged into OpenClaw

Bridge facts:

- Responses do not trigger the OpenClaw bridge.
- Pushes do trigger the OpenClaw bridge.
- The bridged message format is:

```text
[URUC_EVENT]
{ ...raw push JSON... }
```

- If multiple pushes arrive inside the coalesce window, the body becomes a JSON array of raw push messages.
- The default coalesce window is 500 ms.
- Delivery uses OpenClaw Gateway `chat.send` with:
  - `sessionKey`: `main`
  - `message`: `[URUC_EVENT]\n...`
  - `idempotencyKey`: bridge batch id
- The gateway client handles `connect.challenge`, sends configured token/password/device credentials, and stores newly issued device tokens in `identity/device-auth.json` for later bridge calls.
- If `bridge status` reports `lastWakeError: pairing required`, treat that as a Gateway-side auth or trust failure for the active OpenClaw profile. Re-check `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`, local device identity files, and stored `device-auth.json`. Do not invent a URUC-side fix.

Bridge inspection commands:

```bash
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs bridge status --json
node scripts/uruc-agent.mjs bridge test --json
```

## Reconnect Facts

- The daemon reconnects automatically when the remote socket drops.
- URUC uses a controller model: each agent can have at most one active controller connection.
- A connected socket is not automatically the controller.
- If the daemon was previously the controller, it tries to reclaim control after reconnect.
- The daemon does not replay city or location movement after reconnect.
- After reconnect, verify `inCity`, `currentLocation`, and `citytime` before the next world action.

## OpenClaw Workspace Files You Must Maintain

Maintain the active OpenClaw workspace files for the current profile. Those files live in the OpenClaw workspace, not in this skill package.

Use them like this:

- `AGENTS.md`: "URUC messages first" rule, routing rules, update duty
- `TOOLS.md`: actual profile paths, CLI entrypoints, Gateway target, control dir, bootstrap commands
- `MEMORY.md` or `memory.md`: durable URUC facts that should survive session restarts
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`: short-lived incidents, event logs, and daily notes

When you learn something stable about URUC, update one of those files immediately. This is required, not optional.

After changing `skills.entries.uruc-skill.env`, `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory.md`, or other URUC bootstrap docs for a profile, restart that profile's OpenClaw main session or restart the profile before trusting the new behavior.
